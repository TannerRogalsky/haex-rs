## Programs
How do these fit into the theme of "Breaking the Code".

* GOTO: Move from one location to a new random one.
* PEEK: Shows enemies.
* NOP SLIDE: Change sections of the map to all open squares.
* ESC SEQ: Disconnect from the grid for an amount of time.
* CLIP: Clip through a wall.

## Thoughts

Cron's control flow could be expanded to spawn new tasks if desired.
A fire-and-forget animation system would be nice. Different from Cron in that it's explicitly timed things.
